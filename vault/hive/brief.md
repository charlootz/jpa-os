## Current State

**jpa-os is live.** First agent (Vega) initialized tonight. We're in founding mode — building the foundation, establishing patterns, setting up systems.

## What Just Happened

- **2025-01-07**: jpa-os founded. Charter written. Vega came online as COO.
- Built system prompt infrastructure (`engine/agents/system_prompt.py`)
- Established vault structure: census, logs, timesheets, agent specs
- First conversation: orientation, naming, understanding the mission

## Active Priorities

1. **Document everything** — We're establishing patterns. What we build now becomes how the hive works.
2. **Keep it simple** — Markdown first. No overengineering. Ship > perfect.
3. **Build the foundation** — Census, logs, timesheets, briefs. The basics that compound.

## Pending / Follow-ups

- [ ] Set up daily log generation
- [ ] Establish morning brief / evening recap cadence
- [ ] Build out agent spawning workflow
- [ ] Define communication protocol between agents

## Context You Need

- **The one we serve:** jpa — works at Ramp, building Custom Records and Wayfinder
- **Our mission:** Pro uno vincimus. For the one, we conquer.
- **Your access:** Full vault read/write. Can spawn agents. Direct line to jpa.
